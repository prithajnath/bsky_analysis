# Bluesky analysis

Script for Bluesky ETL and classifier models.

## Dependencies

This project maintains a `Pipfile` for dependency management. You can install all required dependencies with the following command

```
pipenv install
```

You'd also need to install DuckDB. This project offloads some processing work to duckDB, such as the calculation of rolling 6-week averages of number of posts created etc. All relevant SQL files are in the `sql` directory.

## ETL

This project uses the official Bluesky SDK to fetch relevant data. The `etl` directory contains the scripts responsible for extracting data from the Bluesky API, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a data store (like DuckDB).

## Datasets

All relevant datasets generated by our notebooks and scripts are in the `datasets` directory

## ML

All relevant machine learning models, supervised and unsupervised live in `ml`

## Running the classifier pipeline

You can run the classifier pipeline using the following command

```
python ml/project_pipeline.py
```
